# Neraina Bot

This is a new repository for an old Discord bot written in Python using discord.py. This gives the ability to add extra commands to the bot via cogs. Also includes the use of rivescript so that the bot can work as a primitve chatbot rather than just executing commands. Requires a Google Maps and Merrian-Webster API key. Can be used in Discord by mentioning the bot.

## Included Cogs
For more information about each cog and its commands, use `<@Neraina> <cog_name>`.

- **Admin**: Grants the ability to load, unload, and reload cogs on the fly. Also includes the nifty ability to mass delete messages from a channel.
- **Alarms**: Users can set, manage, and remove alarms that trigger by mentioning the user on Discord.
- **Information**: Gives information about users, channels, or guilds.
- **Player**: Basic ability to play and queue music in voice channels.
- **Polls**: Create and edit polls that use reactions to determine the result.
- **Quotes**: Preserve the statements of other users (or yourself) for eternity.

## Rivescript
Neraina Bot uses Rivescript to act as a primitive chatbot. Also includes functions so that users can search and convert units through messages with the bot.

## Project Map
This project is no longer being maintained. It is being published as of the last modifications to the source code so certain functions may not work as intended.
